    "\n",
    "*1. Rules*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is conditional formatting in Excel? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Conditional formatting in Excel is a feature that allows you to apply specific formatting to cells that meet certain criteria or conditions. For example, you can highlight cells with values greater than a certain number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How do you apply a basic conditional formatting rule in Excel? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Select the range of cells you want to format, go to the \"Home\" tab, click on \"Conditional Formatting,\" and then choose \"Highlight Cells Rules\" or \"Top/Bottom Rules\" and define your criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Can you create custom conditional formatting rules? Provide an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Yes, you can create custom rules using formulas. For example, to highlight cells with values greater than the average, you can use the formula =A1>AVERAGE($A$1:$A$10) in the \"Use a formula to determine which cells to format\" option. \n",

    "*6. Normalization* \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is normalization in database design? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Normalization is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by dividing the database into tables and defining relationships between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain the first normal form (1NF). \n",
    "\n",
    "--> A table is in 1NF if all columns contain only atomic, indivisible values and each column contains values of a single type. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql \n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees ( \n",
    "id INT PRIMARY KEY, \n",
    "name VARCHAR(100), \n",
    "phone_number VARCHAR(15) \n",
    "); \n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the second normal form (2NF)? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key columns are fully dependent on the primary key. This often involves removing partial dependencies by creating additional tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Explain the third normal form (3NF). \n",
    "\n",
    "--> A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and all non-key columns are not only dependent on the primary key but also independent of each other. This removes transitive dependencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. What is an ER diagram in database design? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> An ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram is a graphical representation of entities and their relationships in a database. It shows how tables (entities) are connected and interact with each other. \n",
    " \n",
    "6. What are the main components of an ER diagram? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> The main components are entities (represented by rectangles), attributes (represented by ovals), \n",
    "and relationships (represented by diamonds or lines).  \n",
    "\n",
    "*8. Primary and Foreign Keys* \n",
    " \n",
    "7. What is a primary key in a database? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. For example: \n",
    "```sql \n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees ( id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100) ); \n",
    "``` \n",
    " \n",
    "8. What is a foreign key in a database? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> A foreign key is a column or a set of columns that establishes a link between the data in two tables. It references the primary key of another table. For example: \n",

    "CREATE TABLE orders ( order_id INT PRIMARY KEY, employee_id INT, FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(id) ); \n",
    "``` \n",
    " \n",
    "9. Explain the purpose of a foreign key constraint. \n",
    "\n",
    "--> A foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity by enforcing a link between the foreign key column and the primary key column it references, preventing invalid data entry. \n",

    "*9. Advanced Questions on Database Design* \n",
    "\n",
    "1. How would you design a database for a library management system? Outline the main tables and their relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Design involves creating tables like `Books`, `Authors`, `Members`, `Loans`, and establishing relationships. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql \n",
    "CREATE TABLE Books ( \n",
    "book_id INT PRIMARY KEY, \n",
    "title VARCHAR(255), \n",
    "author_id INT, \n",
    "FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES Authors(author_id) \n",
    "); \n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Authors ( \n",
    "author_id INT PRIMARY KEY, \n",
    "name VARCHAR(255) \n",
    "); \n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Members ( \n",
    "member_id INT PRIMARY KEY, \n",
    "name VARCHAR(255) \n",
    "); \n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Loans ( \n",
    "loan_id INT PRIMARY KEY, \n",
    "book_id INT, \n",
    "member_id INT, \n",
    "loan_date DATE, \n",
    "return_date DATE, \n",
    "FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES Books(book_id), \n",
    "FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES Members(member_id) \n",
    "); \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "2. What is denormalization and when would you use it? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Denormalization is the process of combining tables to reduce the number of joins and improve query performance. It is used when read performance is more critical than write performance, such as in data warehousing. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. How can you enforce data integrity in a database design?  \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Data integrity can be enforced using constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints, and triggers. For example:\n",
    " \n",
    "```sql \n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees ( \n",
    "id INT PRIMARY KEY, \n",
    "name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, \n",
    "email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE \n",
    "); \n",
    "```"

    "\n",
    "*1. Bar, Line, Pie Charts, Maps, Tables, Matrix* \n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do you create a bar chart in Power BI?  \n",
    "\n",
    "--> To create a bar chart, select the bar chart icon from the Visualizations pane, then drag and drop the desired fields into the Axis and Values sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the process for creating a line chart in Power BI? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Select the line chart icon from the Visualizations pane and drag the fields into the Axis and Values sections to plot the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. How can you create a pie chart in Power BI? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Select the pie chart icon from the Visualizations pane and drag the fields into the Legend and Values sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. How do you visualize geographical data using maps in Power BI? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Use the map visual by selecting the map icon from the Visualizations pane and placing geographical data (like city or country) into the Location field and other data into the Values field. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. What steps are involved in creating a table in Power BI? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Select the table icon from the Visualizations pane and drag the fields into the Values section to display the data in a tabular format. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. How do you create a matrix in Power BI? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Select the matrix icon from the Visualizations pane, then drag fields into the Rows, Columns, and Values sections to organize data in a pivot-table format. \n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Advanced Questions on Creating Visuals* \n",
    "\n",
    "1. How can you create a combination chart with bars and lines in Power BI? \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Use the combo chart by selecting the Line and Stacked Column Chart icon from the Visualizations pane and adding the appropriate fields to the Shared Axis, Column Values, and Line Values sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain how to create a filled map versus a bubble map in Power BI. \n",
    "\n",
    "--> A filled map requires geographical data in the Location field and numerical data in the Values field. A bubble map requires geographical data in the Location field and data in the Size field to determine the size of the bubbles. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. How can you use slicers to filter data in visualizations? \n",
    "\n",
